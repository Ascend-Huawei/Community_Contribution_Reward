- How to participate:
   You participate by creating new 'issue' in this repo with Title 'Contribution Reward Application', and provide link and name of your pull request in either repo.
- Evaluation
   After you created the application, we will evaluate your contribution based on its Innovation, Quality, and Complexity, then notify you whether you have won the prize and which prize you can get. If you accept the prize, we will deliver the prize to you.

**Note:** by creating an issue for participating the competition, it means you have carefully read and agree with the [ASCEND COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION COMPETITION RULE](ASCEND_COMMUNITY_CONTRIBUTION_COMPETITION_RULES.md).
